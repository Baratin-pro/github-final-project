## Simple Interest Calculator

A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

### Input:
- `p`: Principal amount
- `t`: Time period in years
- `r`: Annual rate of interest

### Output:
- Simple interest = `p * t * r`

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   Open a terminal and execute the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Baratin-pro/github-final-project.git
   ```
3. **Navigate to the project folder**:

    cd github-final-project
    ```
## Usage 
def calculate_simple_interest(p, t, r):
    return (p * t * r) / 100

### Example usage
principal = 1000
time = 2  # years
rate = 5  # percent

simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, time, rate)
print(f"Simple Interest: {simple_interest}")

### Expected Output:
Simple Interest: 100.0
